Our project explores the **relationship between student lifestyles and sleeping patterns**, highlighting how daily habits impact academic performance and overall well-being. Using a kaggle dataset of 500 university students, we analyze key factors such as sleep duration(hours), study hours, screen time(hours), caffeine intake, physical activity(minutes), and sleep quality, alongside demographics like age, gender, and academic year. By uncovering these patterns, we aim to provide insights that help students make better lifestyle choices for improved health and academic success.
